# 1. NumPy matrix calculation
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

A = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]])
type(A)    # numpy.ndarray

AM = np.mat(A
type(AM)   # numpy.matrix
```
**array and matrix can both represent matrix in NumPy.** Which type we should choose above? ndarray is more faster and efficiency than matrix. **ndarray is more popular.** Also, muliplication of matrix and ndarray is also different
```python
AM *  AM  # matrix mulplication
A.dot(A)  # array mulplication
```
# 2. Special matrix construction in NumPy
```python
np.eye(n)
np.diag(a1)
np.diag(a1,1) # move 1 line upward
np.triu(a) # triangular upper
np.tril(a) # triangular lower

a1=np.arrange(1,7).reshape(2,3)
a1.T # transverse
```
# 3. Numpy matrix basic calculation
Since we select array to represent matrix, therefore two dimensional array have dual properties for both array and matrix. For array property, the basic operation is relatively simple. For matrix, the operation is relatively complex.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> array and matrix can both represent matrix in NumPy. We select array to represent matrix. array has dual properties for both array and matrix.
```python
a = np.arrange(4)  # * element by element
a*a

np.dot (a,a) # . array dot multiply
a.dot(a)
npvdot(a,a)
np.inner(a,a)

np.vdot(A,A) # . matrix dot multiply

a1=np.arrange(1,7).reshape(2,3) # matrix multiply
a2=np.arrange(1,7).reshape(3,3)
np.matmul(a1,a2)
```
> [!NOTE]
> Innder dot requires two arrays or matrix got the same shape. Matrix multiple requires A's column number and B's row number got the same.
> Array and Matrix both got inner dot calculation. Corresponding elements first multiple then sum, it's a scalar finally. 

# 4. NumPy matrix algebraic operations
```python
np.trace(A)
np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
np.linalg.det(A)
np.linalg.inv(A)
```
## 4.1 maxtrix equation and array derivative method
```python
np.linalg.solve(A, B)
```
## 4.2 array derivative method
# 5. Least square method derivation
```python
np.linalg.inv(X.T.dot(X)).dot(X.T).dot(y)
