# 1. Decision Boundary
We can use experience or theorical method to evaluate a model's capabilities. Additionaly, we can also use draw model's decition boundary to evaluate model capability.
Decision boundary essentially is a visiualization method. We can also use decision boundary to check if a model is overfit or underfit. Drawing model decision boundary as following steps:
- Step 1. Observate sample distribution
- Step 2. Train model with give sample data
- Step 3. Classify each point in the given space with the trained model
- Step 4. Add sample nodes back to the sample space

> [!NOTE]
> Most models are trying to find a effective decision boundary to classify data. In some cases, models will try to change sample space in Step 1 first (for example transfer 2-D sample space to 3-D with kernel). Then it will figure out a decision surface or hyperplane to classify the data.

Drawing logistic regression's decision bounary as follows
```python
x1, x2 = np.meshgrid(np.arrange(3), np.arrange(1,4))
np.concatenate([x1.reshape(-1,1), x2.reshape(-1,1), x3.reshape(-1,1)])
```
