# 1. Decision Tree Modeling Process
Decision tree modeling is an important supervised learning algorithm. Like previous clustering algorithms, decision tree model is a general caterogy for a type of model.
Decision tree models are very high efficiency, high prediction accuracy, process is simple and clear, and it is a "white-box" model.
**Decision tree models can do both regression and classification prediction**, it also can output feature significance. In essemble learning, the most commonly used basic classifier is tree model.

## 1.1 Build decision tree iwth logistic regression
The essentials of building a decision tree is to dig effective classification rules.

## 1.2 Decision tree categories
Decision tree model is not an algorithm, it is a category of algorithms. Followings are most popular ones:
- ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)、C4.5、 C5.0 decision tree
- CART decisioin tree (classification and regression trees), or C&RT. sklearn decision tree is mostly based on CART model.
- CHAID decition tree (Chi-square automatic interaction detection).

# 2. CART classification trees using sklearn
## 2.1 CART classification process
How do we build the estimator is the key factor. Accuracy is no more suitable for decision trees. We use purity as the key estimator. Here are three key purity estimators for CART:
- Classification error
- Entropy
- Gini
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ID3、C4.5、C5.0 use entropy
> Cart use Gini
> Greedy algorithm use classification error
Another question is to estimator multiple data sets' purity.
