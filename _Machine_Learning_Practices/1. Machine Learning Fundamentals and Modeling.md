Key concepts in machine learning modeling:
- Model estimator: accuracy
- Model parameters
- Model training

# 1. Loss function
- A function with variables of model parameters
- Given a sample data, it can evaluate model's performance (like model evaluation criteria)
- It can reflect back to original model and help improve model performance 
Usually use SSE, MSE and RMSE

# 2. General machine learning procedure
- Step 1: Propose basic modeling
- Step 2: Determine loss function
- Step 3: Select optimization method based on loss function (for example lse method)
- Step 4: Use selected optimization method to solve loss function (most case we solve loss functions' minimul value)
