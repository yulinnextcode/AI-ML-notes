[Understanding frameworks, libraries, and packages](https://datasciencedojo.com/blog/frameworks-libraries-and-packages/#:~:text=While%20frameworks%20provide%20structure%20and,component%20for%20successful%20software%20development).

[Framework vs library vs package vs module](https://dev.to/hamza/framework-vs-library-vs-package-vs-module-the-debate-3jpp).
> Module
> 
> Is the smallest piece of software. A module is a set of methods or functions ready to be used somewhere else.
> 
> Package
> 
> Is a collection of modules. This may sound funny, but usually what a package does, is gather a number of modules holding in general the same functional purpose. Making it easier to include all the related modules at once.
> 
> Library
> 
> Well library at it's core, is a collections of packages. It's purpose is to offer a set of functionalities ready to use without worrying about the subsequent packages. So a library is what you include when you want to add some functionality to your code. It does not force any coding style on you either.
> 
> Framework
> 
> It's a set of libraries. But this time, the framework does not just offer functionalities, but it also provides an architecture for the development work. In other words you don't include a framework. You integrate you code into it. He is the wire frame of the project. That's why a framework forces its coding style on you.
