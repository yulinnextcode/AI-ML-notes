PyTorch is a deep learning third-party library. It is an open-source machine learning lbirary based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.

PyTorch is known for its flexibility and ease of use. It is written in Python and is compatible with popular Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy. PyTorch is used in applications like: Image recognition, Language processing, Reinforcement learning, and Natural language classification.

## 1.1 Create tensor with function method
The basic method to create a tensor is similar as NumPy to create a array. Both use a function method as follows.

## 1.2 Tensor types
```python
t1 = torch.tensor([1,3]) # with list, return tensor([1,3])
t1.dtype  # return torch.int64
t2 = torch.tensor((1,3)) # with tuple, return tensor([1,3])
t2.dtype  # return torch.int64
# t1 and t2 are the same

a=np.array((1,3))
t3=torch.tensor(a) # with array, return tensor([1,3], dtype=torch.int32)
```
> [!NOTE]
> Based on above outputs we can conclude:
> To create int tensor: using list and tuple will create int64 tensor by default, using array will create int32 tensor by default.
> To create float tensor: using list and tuple will create float32 tensor by default, using array will create float64 tensor by default.

```python
t4=torch.tensor([True, False])  # output tensor([True, False])
t4.dtype    # output torch.bool


t5=torch.tensor([1.1, 2.7], dtype=torch.int16)   # t5 is tensor([1,2], dtype=torch.int16)
```
## 1.3 Tensor type convert
