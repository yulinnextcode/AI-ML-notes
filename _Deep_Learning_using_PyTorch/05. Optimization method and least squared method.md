AutoGrad module is an important tool in PyTorch.

Loss Function
It is a differentiable function that calculates loss or error for a training record. It is used for training a model using optimization techniques such as Gradient Descent.

Cost Function
It is the average error for all the records in the training set calculated by the loss function.

Objective Function
Reducing the error is not the only purpose. It will make the model very well trained on the training data and perform poorly on the test data. That is overfitting. We want the model to be well generalized, and for that we add regularization to the cost function that constitutes the objective function. In lot many cases, the loss function is considered an objective function as well.
> [!TIP]
> Loss function: calculated on one data sample
> Cost function: calculated on all data sample and get averaged errors
> Objective function: cost function + regularizer
