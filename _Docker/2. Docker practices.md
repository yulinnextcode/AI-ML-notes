# Image vs Container
## image
- Docker image is a read-only file
- Docker image is the template loaded onto the container to run it, like a set of instructions
- Users can create their own image, or they can pull from registry (such as docker hub)
## container
- Container is a running image
- A Docker container is a self-contained, runnable software application or service.
- It is a runtime environment with all the necessary components, like code, dependencies, and libraries, needed to run the application code without using host machine dependencies.
# Create a container
```powershell
docker container run nginx/docker run nginx
docker container ls/docker ps
docker container stop (container_name or container_id)/docker stop (container_name or container_id)
docker container rm container_id/docker rm container_id
both formats are acceptable
```
