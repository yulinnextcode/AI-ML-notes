# 1. Persistence
Docker is open-source, virtualization software created to make developer's life easy. It is a kind of PaaS (platform-as-a-service) product whose core objective is to isolate virtual environments to deploy, build, and test applications that are usually incompatible or not meant to work with the current OS.

Docker provides two ways for persistence:
- Data Volume, storage data at Docker area (specified by Docker)
- Bind Mount, storage data at the location specified by user

As we see from the following figure. Here are some kay points about docker image vs docker container:
- Docker images are nothing but a read-only template that can’t be executed by themselves and cannot run or start.
- Docker containers are nothing but a box that has the ability to run the docker image templates. The moment you create a container using those immutable images you essentially end up creating a read-write copy of that filesystem (docker image) inside the given container. This adds a container layer which helps you to modify the entire copy of the given Docker image.
- A Docker container is a self-contained, runnable software application or service. On the other hand, a Docker image is the template loaded onto the container to run it, like a set of instructions.
- An image is an inert, immutable, file that's essentially a snapshot of a container. Images are created with the build command, and they'll produce a container when started with run. Images are stored in a Docker registry such as registry.hub.docker.com. Because they can become quite large, images are designed to be composed of layers of other images, allowing a minimal amount of data to be sent when transferring images over the network.
- To use a programming metaphor, if an image is a class, then a container is an instance of a class—a runtime object. Containers are hopefully why you're using Docker; they're lightweight and portable encapsulations of an environment in which to run applications.
- Although Docker images and containers have a similar purpose (to package and deploy software efficiently), they have different uses. An image is a snapshot of an environment, while a container runs the software.

Docker image is a kind of ready-to-use software read-only template crafted with source codes, libraries, external dependencies, tools, and other miscellaneous files that are needed for any software application to run successfully on any platform or OS. The developer community also likes to call it Snapshots, representing the app and its virtual environment at a specific point in time.

Docker containers are nothing but a box that has the ability to run the docker image templates. The moment you create a container using those immutable images you essentially end up creating a read-write copy of that filesystem (docker image) inside the given container. This adds a container layer which helps you to modify the entire copy of the given Docker image.

Key difference between docker image vs docker container:
- The key difference between a Docker image Vs a container is that a Docker image is a read-only immutable template that defines how a container will be realized. A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image that gets created when the $ docker run command is implemented.
- Before the docker container can even exist docker templates/images are built using $ docker build CLI.
- Docker image templates can exist in isolation but containers can't exist without images.
- So docker image is an integral part of containers that differs only because of their objectives which we have already covered.
- Docker images can’t be paused or started but a Docker container is a run time instance that can be started or paused.
