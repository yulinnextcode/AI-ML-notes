# How to get an image
- pull from registry (online, most popular registry is dockhub)
  - public
  - private
- build from Dockerfile (online)
- load from file (offline)
- commit from container

```
docker image pull     #pull an image or a repository from a registry, docker image pull nginx:1.20.0
docker image ls
docker image inspect image_id
docker image rm image_id
docker image save nginx:1.20.0 -o nginx.image
docker image load -i .\nginx.image
docker image build -t hello:1.0 .    # . is to specify dockerfile location
docker image push [options] NAME[:TAG]
docker container commit id rep123/nginx   # create image from containersnip 
```

# Dockerfile introduction
> Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
- Dockerfile is a file used to build docker image
- Dockerfile includes all the "instructions" to build a docker image
- Dockerfile has specific synatax requirements.

A simple file structure. Assume following file is called Dockerfile. The CMD will only be exuecuted when we create a container using the image (docker run -it hello).
```
FROM ubuntu:21.04
RUN apt-get update && \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y python3.9 python3-pip python3
ADD hello.py /
CMD ["python3", "/hello.py"]
```
Here is the docker file reference [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/).

Assume we have two files places at one folder: the above Dockerfile and hello.py, we need to use following commands to build image
```
docker image build -t hello .
# . means create the new image at current folder
# -t means tag
# we can also use hello:1.0, means version 1.0. If nothing added, means the latest version.
```
How to share the created image? Push to docker hub
```
docker image tag hello test/hello:1.0   # copy a hello and rename to test/hello
docker login                            # log in docker hub with username and password
docker image push test/hello:1.0        # test is your docker hub id
```

# About scratch image
Scratch is an empty docker image. We can use scratch to build a base image.
hello.c
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("hello docker\n");
}
```
Dockerfile
```
FROM scratch
ADD hello /
CMD ["/hello"]
```
build from above above
```
$ docker build -t hello .
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
hello        latest    2936e77a9daa   40 minutes ago   872kB
```
run the container
```
$ docker container run -it hello
hello docker
```
