# Dockerfile introduction
> Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
- Dockerfile is a file used to build docker image
- Dockerfile includes all the "instructions" to build a docker image
- Dockerfile has specific synatax requirements.
