## New Database Query Paradigm
The following diagram clearly explains the process driven by an LLM, from natural language (fuzzy) queries to natural language query result outputs.

![](images/713462/60ffbcbe5a891ae74a12d3d5d24cf426.jpg)

This paradigm combines the functionalities of natural language processing and traditional database queries, providing users with a more intuitive and efficient interaction method. Let me explain the process:

1. Ask a Question: The user asks a question in natural language, such as “What was the total sales last year?”
2. LLM Understanding and Translation: The LLM first parses the question, understanding the intent and the required information. Then, based on the parsed content, the model generates the corresponding SQL query, such as “SELECT SUM(sales) FROM sales_data WHERE year = ‘last_year’;”
3. Execute SQL Query: The generated SQL query is sent to the corresponding database for execution. The database processes this query and returns the required data results.
4. LLM Receives and Interprets Results: When the database returns the query results, the LLM receives this data. The LLM then parses this data and converts it into a format that is easier for humans to understand.
5. Provide Answer: Finally, the LLM converts the results into a natural language answer and returns it to the user. For example, “The total sales last year were 1,000,000 yuan.”
As you can see, users do not need to know the structure of the database or have the skills to write SQL. They only need to ask questions in natural language and can get the answers they need. This greatly simplifies the interaction process with the database and offers tremendous potential for various application scenarios.

## Practical Case Background Information
Next, we will implement this new database application development paradigm using LangChain.

In this practical case, all our business data is stored in a database, and the goal is to create various queries for the sales data of each type of flower through natural language. This way, whether it’s employees or customers, when they want to know the price of a specific flower, they can quickly generate the appropriate query.

This greatly simplifies the query process and difficulty.

First, this application can be simply used as a query tool, allowing employees to quickly look up prices in the inventory or sales system. Employees no longer need to remember complex query statements or perform manual searches; they just need to select the type of flower and tell the system what they want, and the system will generate the correct query for them.

Secondly, this template can also be integrated into a chatbot or customer service bot. Customers can directly ask the bot, “What is the price of red roses?” The bot will call LangChain and the LLM based on the input, generate the appropriate query, and then return the exact price to the customer. This not only improves service efficiency but also enhances the user experience.

Having understood the project background, let’s get started!

## Creating Database Tables
First, let’s create a series of database tables to store the business data of Easy Speed Flowers.

Here, we use SQLite as our example database. It provides a lightweight disk file database that does not require a separate server process or system; applications can interact directly with the database file. It also does not require configuration, installation, or management, making it very suitable for desktop applications, embedded applications, or the simple needs of startups.

SQLite supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), meaning your database operations are safe even in the event of system crashes or power failures. Although SQLite is considered lightweight, it supports most standard SQL features, including transactions, triggers, and views.

Therefore, it is particularly suitable for applications that do not need all the features of large database systems but still require data persistence, such as mobile applications or small web applications. Of course, it is also very suitable for our demo.

The sqlite3 library is a lightweight SQLite database built into Python. Through the sqlite3 library, Python provides developers with a simple and direct way to create, query, and manage SQLite databases. When you install Python, the sqlite3 module is already included, so no additional installation is required.

Based on this sqlite3 library, the code to create business data is as follows:

```plain
# 导入sqlite3库
import sqlite3

# 连接到数据库
conn = sqlite3.connect('FlowerShop.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# 执行SQL命令来创建Flowers表
cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE Flowers (
            ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            Name TEXT NOT NULL,
            Type TEXT NOT NULL,
            Source TEXT NOT NULL,
            PurchasePrice REAL,
            SalePrice REAL,
            StockQuantity INTEGER,
            SoldQuantity INTEGER,
            ExpiryDate DATE,
            Description TEXT,
            EntryDate DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
        );
    ''')

# 插入5种鲜花的数据
flowers = [
    ('Rose', 'Flower', 'France', 1.2, 2.5, 100, 10, '2023-12-31', 'A beautiful red rose'),
    ('Tulip', 'Flower', 'Netherlands', 0.8, 2.0, 150, 25, '2023-12-31', 'A colorful tulip'),
    ('Lily', 'Flower', 'China', 1.5, 3.0, 80, 5, '2023-12-31', 'An elegant white lily'),
    ('Daisy', 'Flower', 'USA', 0.7, 1.8, 120, 15, '2023-12-31', 'A cheerful daisy flower'),
    ('Orchid', 'Flower', 'Brazil', 2.0, 4.0, 50, 2, '2023-12-31', 'A delicate purple orchid')
]

for flower in flowers:
    cursor.execute('''
        INSERT INTO Flowers (Name, Type, Source, PurchasePrice, SalePrice, StockQuantity, SoldQuantity, ExpiryDate, Description)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);
    ''', flower)

# 提交更改
conn.commit()

# 关闭数据库连接
conn.close()

```

First, we connect to the FlowerShop.db database. Then, we create a new table named Flowers, which will store various data related to each type of flower.

The table has the following fields:

![](images/713462/d569yy552347e51ba9514a183yyef731.jpg)

Next, we create a list named flowers, which contains all the relevant data for 5 types of flowers. Using a for loop, we iterate through the flowers list and insert the data for each flower into the Flowers table. We then commit these changes to save them to the database. Finally, we close the connection to the database.

## Querying the Database with Chain
Since LangChain’s database query functionality is relatively new and still experimental, you need to install the langchain-experimental package, which includes the experimental new features of LangChain.

```plain
pip install langchain-experimental

```
下面，我们就开始通过SQLDatabaseChain来查询数据库。代码如下：

```plain
# 导入langchain的实用工具和相关的模块
from langchain.utilities import SQLDatabase
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain_experimental.sql import SQLDatabaseChain

# 连接到FlowerShop数据库（之前我们使用的是Chinook.db）
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///FlowerShop.db")

# 创建OpenAI的低级语言模型（LLM）实例，这里我们设置温度为0，意味着模型输出会更加确定性
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, verbose=True)

# 创建SQL数据库链实例，它允许我们使用LLM来查询SQL数据库
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)

# 运行与鲜花运营相关的问题
response = db_chain.run("有多少种不同的鲜花？")
print(response)

response = db_chain.run("哪种鲜花的存货数量最少？")
print(response)

response = db_chain.run("平均销售价格是多少？")
print(response)

response = db_chain.run("从法国进口的鲜花有多少种？")
print(response)

response = db_chain.run("哪种鲜花的销售量最高？")
print(response)

```

Here, we import the necessary LangChain modules, then connect to the FlowerShop database and initialize an OpenAI LLM instance. After that, we use SQLDatabaseChain to create a link from the LLM to the database.

Finally, we use the db_chain.run() method to query multiple questions related to flower operations. Internally, the Chain converts these natural language queries into SQL statements, queries the database tables, and then converts the results back into natural language using the LLM.

Therefore, the output of the Chain is understandable and can be directly passed to a chatbot.

The output is as follows:

![](images/713462/04b4de7c9fd93a98cc58e6de2f8aaaaa.jpg)

The SQLDatabaseChain calls the large language model, perfectly completing the new type of SQL query from natural language (input) to natural language (output).

## Querying the Database with an Agent
In addition to querying the database through a Chain, LangChain can also complete query tasks through an SQL Agent. Compared to SQLDatabaseChain, using an SQL Agent has some advantages:

- It can answer questions based on the database schema and content (e.g., it will retrieve the description of specific tables).
- It has error correction capabilities. When the generated query encounters an error, it can capture the error and correctly regenerate and execute a new query.
LangChain uses the create_sql_agent function to initialize the agent. The SQL agent created through this function includes the SQLDatabaseToolkit, which contains the following tools:

- Creating and executing queries
- Checking query syntax
- Retrieving descriptions of data tables
With the help of these tools, the agent can drive the LLM to complete SQL query tasks. The code is as follows:

```plain
from langchain.utilities import SQLDatabase
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import create_sql_agent
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit
from langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType

# 连接到FlowerShop数据库
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///FlowerShop.db")
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, verbose=True)

# 创建SQL Agent
agent_executor = create_sql_agent(
    llm=llm,
    toolkit=SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=llm),
    verbose=True,
    agent_type=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
)

# 使用Agent执行SQL查询

questions = [
    "哪种鲜花的存货数量最少？",
    "平均销售价格是多少？",
]

for question in questions:
    response = agent_executor.run(question)
    print(response)

```
As you can see, unlike Chains that directly generate SQL statements, agents use ReAct-style prompts. First, after thinking, it determines that the first action is to use the tool sql_db_list_tables. Then, it observes the table returned by this tool, thinks again, and determines the next action is sql_db_schema, which is to create SQL statements, progressing step by step until the answer is obtained.

## Summary
Today’s content is easy to understand and very enlightening. What I want to emphasize most is the shift from the programming paradigm of “telling the computer what to do” to “telling the computer what we want.”

This shift has profound implications.

1. Greater Accessibility: No need for deep technical knowledge or specific programming background. This means non-technical personnel, such as business analysts, project managers, and even end-users, can directly interact with data.
2. High Efficiency and Productivity: Traditional programming methods require a lot of time and effort, especially in complex data operations. Natural language processing and understanding can significantly reduce this burden, making complex data operations more intuitive.
3. Error Reduction: Many programming errors stem from misunderstandings of specific syntax or structure. Using natural language can greatly reduce these errors.
4. Closer Human-Machine Integration: In this new paradigm, machines act more like human partners rather than just tools. They can understand our needs and provide solutions without us having to explicitly guide every step.
However, this shift also brings challenges.

1. Ambiguity Issues: Natural language is inherently ambiguous, and machines must accurately interpret this ambiguity and seek clarification when necessary.
2. Dependence on Existing Systems: While natural language queries are appealing, many existing systems may not support or be compatible with this new paradigm.
3. Over-Reliance: If we rely too much on machines to make decisions for us, we may lose a deep understanding of the data and the ability to question the results.
We are at a moment of technological transformation, where the boundaries between natural language and programming are disappearing. For those willing to embrace and adopt this new paradigm, the future is full of infinite possibilities.
