First, please recall what we learned in Lesson 4: generating attractive descriptions for some flowers and their prices, and storing these descriptions and reasons in a CSV file. To achieve this goal, the program called the OpenAI model and utilized a structured output parser, along with some data processing and storage tools.

Today, I will take you to delve into the output parser in LangChain and use a new parser—the Pydantic parser—to refactor the program. This lesson is also the final lecture of the Model I/O framework.

## LangChain output parser

An output parser is a class specifically designed to handle and construct responses from language models. A basic output parser class typically needs to implement two core methods:

- get_format_instructions: This method needs to return a string that guides how to format the output of the language model, telling it how to organize and construct its response.
- parse: This method receives a string (the output of the language model) and parses it into a specific data structure or format. This step is usually used to ensure that the model’s output meets our expectations and can be processed in the form we need.
There is also an optional method:

- parse_with_prompt: This method receives a string (the output of the language model) and a prompt (the prompt used to generate this output) and parses it into a specific data structure. This way, you can correct or re-parse the model’s output based on the original prompt, ensuring that the output information is more accurate and meets the requirements.
Below is a simple pseudocode example based on the above description:

```plain
class OutputParser:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_format_instructions(self):
        # 返回一个字符串，指导如何格式化模型的输出
        pass

    def parse(self, model_output):
        # 解析模型的输出，转换为某种数据结构或格式
        pass

    def parse_with_prompt(self, model_output, prompt):
        # 基于原始提示解析模型的输出，转换为某种数据结构或格式
        pass

```

In LangChain, various output parsers are designed for different use cases and goals by implementing the methods get_format_instructions, parse, and parse_with_prompt. Let’s get to know them one by one.

- 1. List Parser: This parser is used to handle the model-generated output when the output needs to be a list. For example, if you ask the model to “list all the flowers in stock,” the model’s response should be a list.
- 2. Datetime Parser: This parser is used to handle date and time-related outputs, ensuring that the model’s output is in the correct date or time format.
- 3. Enum Parser: This parser is used to handle a predefined set of values when the model’s output should be one of these predefined values. For example, if you define that an answer to a question can only be “yes” or “no,” the enum parser can ensure that the model’s response is one of these options.
- 4. Structured Output Parser: This parser is used to handle complex, structured outputs. If your application requires the model to generate complex responses with a specific structure (such as a report or an article), you can use the structured output parser to achieve this.
- 5. Pydantic (JSON) Parser: This parser is used to handle the model’s output when the output should be a JSON object in a specific format. It uses the Pydantic library, which is a data validation library that can be used to build complex data models and ensure that the model’s output conforms to the expected data model.
- 6. Auto-Fixing Parser: This parser can automatically fix some common model output errors. For example, if the model’s output should be a piece of text but the model returns text with grammatical or spelling errors, the auto-fixing parser can automatically correct these errors.
- 7. RetryWithErrorOutputParser: This parser is used to attempt to fix or regenerate new output when the model’s initial output does not meet expectations. For example, if the model’s output should be a date but the model returns a string, the retry parser can re-prompt the model to generate the correct date format.

Among the above parsers, the first three are easy to understand, and you have already used the structured output parser. So next, we will focus on the Pydantic (JSON) parser, the auto-fixing parser, and the retry parser.

## Pydantic (Json) output parser

The Pydantic (JSON) parser is probably the most commonly used and important parser. I’ll guide you through using it to refactor the flower description generation program.

Pydantic is a Python data validation and settings management library, primarily based on Python type hints. Although it is not specifically designed for JSON, Pydantic is particularly useful for handling and validating JSON data due to its common use in modern web applications and API interactions.

### Step 1: Create a Model Instance

First, set the OpenAI API key through environment variables, then use the LangChain library to create an OpenAI model instance. Here, we still choose text-davinci-003 as the large language model.

```plain
# ------Part 1
# 设置OpenAI API密钥
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = '你的OpenAI API Key'

# 创建模型实例
from langchain import OpenAI
model = OpenAI(model_name='text-davinci-003')

```

### Step 2: Define the Output Data Format

First, create an empty DataFrame to store the descriptions generated by the model. Next, define the expected data format (i.e., the data structure) through a Pydantic BaseModel class named FlowerDescription.

```plain
# ------Part 2
# 创建一个空的DataFrame用于存储结果
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(columns=["flower_type", "price", "description", "reason"])

# 数据准备
flowers = ["玫瑰", "百合", "康乃馨"]
prices = ["50", "30", "20"]

# 定义我们想要接收的数据格式
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
class FlowerDescription(BaseModel):
    flower_type: str = Field(description="鲜花的种类")
    price: int = Field(description="鲜花的价格")
    description: str = Field(description="鲜花的描述文案")
    reason: str = Field(description="为什么要这样写这个文案")

```

Here we use the Pydantic library, which is responsible for data format validation, to create a class FlowerDescription with type annotations. It can automatically validate input data to ensure it meets the specified types and other validation conditions.

Pydantic has the following features:

1. Data Validation: When you assign values to a Pydantic class, it automatically performs data validation. For example, if you create a field that needs to be an integer but try to assign a string to it, Pydantic will raise an exception.
2. Data Conversion: Pydantic not only performs data validation but also data conversion. For example, if you have a field that needs to be an integer but you provide a string that can be converted to an integer, such as "42", Pydantic will automatically convert this string to the integer 42.
3. Ease of Use: Creating a Pydantic class is as simple as defining a regular Python class. You just need to use Python’s type annotation feature to specify the type of each field in the class definition.
4. JSON Support: Pydantic classes can easily be created from JSON data and can convert the class data back to JSON format.
Next, we will create a LangChain output parser based on this Pydantic data format class.

### Step 3: Create output parser

In this step, we create the output parser and obtain the output format instructions. First, we use the PydanticOutputParser from the LangChain library to create the output parser, which will be used to parse the model’s output to ensure it conforms to the FlowerDescription format. Then, we use the parser’s get_format_instructions method to obtain the output format instructions.

```plain
# ------Part 3
# 创建输出解析器
from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser
output_parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=FlowerDescription)

# 获取输出格式指示
format_instructions = output_parser.get_format_instructions()
# 打印提示
print("输出格式：",format_instructions)

```
程序输出如下：

```plain
输出格式： The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

{"properties": {"flower_type": {"title": "Flower Type", "description": "\u9c9c\u82b1\u7684\u79cd\u7c7b", "type": "string"}, "price": {"title": "Price", "description": "\u9c9c\u82b1\u7684\u4ef7\u683c", "type": "integer"}, "description": {"title": "Description", "description": "\u9c9c\u82b1\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6587\u6848", "type": "string"}, "reason": {"title": "Reason", "description": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u8fd9\u6837\u5199\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6587\u6848", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["flower_type", "price", "description", "reason"]}

```

It instructs the model to output in the form of a JSON Schema, defining which fields a valid output should contain and the data types of these fields. For example, it specifies that the "flower_type" field should be of string type and the "price" field should be of integer type. This instruction also provides an example of what a well-formatted output looks like.

Next, we will include this content in the model’s prompt, ensuring that the input prompt to the model and the requirements of the output parser align, creating a coherent flow.

### Step 4: Create prompt template

We defined a prompt template that will be used to generate input prompts for the model. The template includes the variables you need the model to fill in (such as price and type of flower), as well as the output format instructions obtained earlier.

```plain
# ------Part 4
# 创建提示模板
from langchain import PromptTemplate
prompt_template = """您是一位专业的鲜花店文案撰写员。
对于售价为 {price} 元的 {flower} ，您能提供一个吸引人的简短中文描述吗？
{format_instructions}"""

# 根据模板创建提示，同时在提示中加入输出解析器的说明
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template,
       partial_variables={"format_instructions": format_instructions})

# 打印提示
print("提示：", prompt)

```
输出：

````plain
提示：
input_variables=['flower', 'price']

output_parser=None

partial_variables={'format_instructions': 'The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\n
As an example, for the schema {
"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}},
"required": ["foo"]}}\n
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.
The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\n
Here is the output schema:\n```\n
{"properties": {
"flower_type": {"title": "Flower Type", "description": "\\u9c9c\\u82b1\\u7684\\u79cd\\u7c7b", "type": "string"},
"price": {"title": "Price", "description": "\\u9c9c\\u82b1\\u7684\\u4ef7\\u683c", "type": "integer"},
"description": {"title": "Description", "description": "\\u9c9c\\u82b1\\u7684\\u63cf\\u8ff0\\u6587\\u6848", "type": "string"},
"reason": {"title": "Reason", "description": "\\u4e3a\\u4ec0\\u4e48\\u8981\\u8fd9\\u6837\\u5199\\u8fd9\\u4e2a\\u6587\\u6848", "type": "string"}},
"required": ["flower_type", "price", "description", "reason"]}\n```'}

template='您是一位专业的鲜花店文案撰写员。
\n对于售价为 {price} 元的 {flower} ，您能提供一个吸引人的简短中文描述吗？\n
{format_instructions}'

template_format='f-string'

validate_template=True

````

This is the prompt template that includes the format_instructions information.

1. input_variables=['flower', 'price']: This is a list of input variables you want to use in the template. We use the variables 'flower' and 'price' in the template, which will later be replaced with specific values (e.g., rose, 20 yuan).
2. output_parser=None: This is an optional output parser you can use in the template. In this example, we do not use an output parser within the template but perform the output parsing externally, so this is set to None.
3. partial_variables: This includes variables you want to use in the template but cannot provide immediately when generating the template. Here, we pass the detailed output format instructions through 'format_instructions'.
4. template: This is the template string itself. It includes the structure of the text you want the model to generate. In this example, the template string is the question you ask about the flower description and the instructions about the output format.
5. template_format='f-string': This is an option indicating the format of the template string. Here, it is in f-string format.
6. validate_template=True: This indicates whether to check the validity of the template when creating it. Here, we choose to check the template’s validity during creation to ensure it is valid.

Overall, this prompt template is a tool for generating model inputs. You can define the required input variables and the format and structure of the template string, then use this template to generate a description for each type of flower.

Next, we will pass the actual information into the prompt template in a loop to generate specific prompts. Let’s continue.

## Step 5: Generate prompt, pass into model and parse output

This part is the main body of the program, where we loop through all the flowers and their prices. For each flower, an input is created based on the prompt template, and then the model’s output is obtained. The previously created parser is then used to parse this output, and the parsed output is added to the DataFrame. Finally, you print out all the results, and you have the option to save them to a CSV file.

```plain
# ------Part 5
for flower, price in zip(flowers, prices):
    # 根据提示准备模型的输入
    input = prompt.format(flower=flower, price=price)
    # 打印提示
    print("提示：", input)

    # 获取模型的输出
    output = model(input)

    # 解析模型的输出
    parsed_output = output_parser.parse(output)
    parsed_output_dict = parsed_output.dict()  # 将Pydantic格式转换为字典

    # 将解析后的输出添加到DataFrame中
    df.loc[len(df)] = parsed_output.dict()

# 打印字典
print("输出的数据：", df.to_dict(orient='records'))

```

In this step, you use your model and input prompt (consisting of the type of flower and price) to generate a specific flower description request (along with format instructions), and then pass it to the large model. This means that the flower and price in the prompt template are replaced with specific flowers, and the {format_instructions} in the template is replaced with the format information specified in the JSON Schema.

Specifically, an output prompt looks like this:

Prompt: You are a professional copywriter for a flower shop.

For a carnation priced at 20 yuan, can you provide an attractive short description in Chinese?

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {“properties”: {“foo”: {“title”: “Foo”, “description”: “a list of strings”, “type”: “array”, “items”: {“type”: “string”}}}, “required”: [“foo”]}}

the object {“foo”: [“bar”, “baz”]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {“properties”: {“foo”: [“bar”, “baz”]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

```
{"properties": {"flower_type": {"title": "Flower Type", "description": "\u9c9c\u82b1\u7684\u79cd\u7c7b", "type": "string"}, "price": {"title": "Price", "description": "\u9c9c\u82b1\u7684\u4ef7\u683c", "type": "integer"}, "description": {"title": "Description", "description": "\u9c9c\u82b1\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6587\u6848", "type": "string"}, "reason": {"title": "Reason", "description": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u8fd9\u6837\u5199\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6587\u6848", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["flower_type", "price", "description", "reason"]}
```

Next, the program parses the model’s output. In this step, you use the previously defined output parser to parse the model’s output into an instance of FlowerDescription. FlowerDescription is a Pydantic class you defined earlier, which includes the type of flower, price, description, and the reason for the description.

Then, the parsed output is added to the DataFrame. In this step, you convert the parsed output (i.e., the FlowerDescription instance) into a dictionary and add this dictionary to your DataFrame. This DataFrame is used to store all flower descriptions.

The final output of the model is as follows:

```plain
输出的数据：
[{'flower_type': 'Rose', 'price': 50, 'description': '玫瑰是最浪漫的花，它具有柔和的粉红色，有着浓浓的爱意，价格实惠，50元就可以拥有一束玫瑰。', 'reason': '玫瑰代表着爱情，是最浪漫的礼物，以实惠的价格，可以让您尽情体验爱的浪漫。'},
{'flower_type': '百合', 'price': 30, 'description': '这支百合，柔美的花蕾，在你的手中摇曳，仿佛在与你深情的交谈', 'reason': '营造浪漫氛围'},
{'flower_type': 'Carnation', 'price': 20, 'description': '艳丽缤纷的康乃馨，带给你温馨、浪漫的气氛，是最佳的礼物选择！', 'reason': '康乃馨是一种颜色鲜艳、芬芳淡雅、具有浪漫寓意的鲜花，非常适合作为礼物，而且20元的价格比较实惠。'}]

```

Therefore, the advantage of Pydantic is its ease of parsing, and the list of dictionaries after parsing is very convenient for data analysis, processing, and storage. Each dictionary represents a record, and its keys (i.e., "flower_type", "price", "description", and "reason") are field names, with the corresponding values being the content of these fields. In this way, each field corresponds to a column, and each dictionary is a row, making it suitable for representation and processing in the form of a DataFrame.

## Practical Use of the OutputFixingParser

Next, let’s see how to use the OutputFixingParser.

First, let’s design an error that occurs during parsing.

```plain
# 导入所需要的库和模块
from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

# 使用Pydantic创建一个数据格式，表示花
class Flower(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="name of a flower")
    colors: List[str] = Field(description="the colors of this flower")
# 定义一个用于获取某种花的颜色列表的查询
flower_query = "Generate the charaters for a random flower."

# 定义一个格式不正确的输出
misformatted = "{'name': '康乃馨', 'colors': ['粉红色','白色','红色','紫色','黄色']}"

# 创建一个用于解析输出的Pydantic解析器，此处希望解析为Flower格式
parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=Flower)
# 使用Pydantic解析器解析不正确的输出
parser.parse(misformatted)

```

这段代码如果运行，会出现错误。

```plain
langchain.schema.output_parser.OutputParserException: Failed to parse Flower from completion {'name': '康乃馨', 'colors': ['粉红色','白色']}. Got: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 1 column 2 (char 1)

```

This error message comes from Python’s built-in JSON parser, which found that the JSON format we input was incorrect. When the program tried to use PydanticOutputParser to parse the JSON string, Python expected the property names to be enclosed in double quotes, but in the given JSON string, they were enclosed in single quotes.

When this error was triggered, the program further raised a custom exception: OutputParserException, which provided more context about the error. This custom exception message indicated that there was an issue when trying to parse the flower object.

As mentioned earlier, the problem lies in the content of the misformatted string:
`"{'name': '康乃馨', 'colors': ['粉红色','白色','红色','紫色','黄色']}"`

应该改为：

`'{"name": "康乃馨", "colors": ["粉红色","白色","红色","紫色","黄色"]}'`

In this way, your JSON string will use the correct double-quote format and should be parsed correctly.

However, I don’t want to solve the problem this way. Instead, I want to try using OutputFixingParser to help us automatically fix similar formatting errors.

```plain
# 从langchain库导入所需的模块
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.output_parsers import OutputFixingParser

# 设置OpenAI API密钥
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = '你的OpenAI API Key'

# 使用OutputFixingParser创建一个新的解析器，该解析器能够纠正格式不正确的输出
new_parser = OutputFixingParser.from_llm(parser=parser, llm=ChatOpenAI())

# 使用新的解析器解析不正确的输出
result = new_parser.parse(misformatted) # 错误被自动修正
print(result) # 打印解析后的输出结果

```

By using the new new_parser instead of Parser for parsing, you will find that the JSON format error issue is resolved, and the program no longer throws an error.

The output is as follows:
```plain
name='Rose' colors=['red', 'pink', 'white']

```

The secret here is that within the OutputFixingParser, the original PydanticOutputParser is called. If it succeeds, it returns the result; if it fails, it passes the misformatted output and formatting instructions to the large language model (LLM) and asks the LLM to perform the necessary fixes.

Amazing, right? The large model not only provides us with knowledge but also helps analyze and resolve program errors at any time.

## RetryWithErrorOutputParser practice

OutputFixingParser is good, but it can only handle simple format fixes. If the error is not just a formatting issue, for example, if the output is incomplete or missing content, then it cannot be fixed based solely on the output and format.

At this point, by implementing the parse_with_prompt method in the output parser, the retry parser provided by LangChain can help us use the reasoning ability of the large language model to retrieve relevant information based on the original prompt.

We can understand the above statement by analyzing a use case of a retry parser.

First, let’s design an error that occurs during the parsing process.

```plain
# 定义一个模板字符串，这个模板将用于生成提问
template = """Based on the user question, provide an Action and Action Input for what step should be taken.
{format_instructions}
Question: {query}
Response:"""

# 定义一个Pydantic数据格式，它描述了一个"行动"类及其属性
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
class Action(BaseModel):
    action: str = Field(description="action to take")
    action_input: str = Field(description="input to the action")

# 使用Pydantic格式Action来初始化一个输出解析器
from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser
parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=Action)

# 定义一个提示模板，它将用于向模型提问
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="Answer the user query.\n{format_instructions}\n{query}\n",
    input_variables=["query"],
    partial_variables={"format_instructions": parser.get_format_instructions()},
)
prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(query="What are the colors of Orchid?")

# 定义一个错误格式的字符串
bad_response = '{"action": "search"}'
parser.parse(bad_response) # 如果直接解析，它会引发一个错误

```

Since bad_response only provides the action field and does not provide the action_input field, which does not match the expected format of the Action data, the parsing will fail.

First, let’s try to use OutputFixingParser to solve this error.

```plain
from langchain.output_parsers import OutputFixingParser
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
fix_parser = OutputFixingParser.from_llm(parser=parser, llm=ChatOpenAI())
parse_result = fix_parser.parse(bad_response)
print('OutputFixingParser的parse结果:',parse_result)

```

utputFixingParser的parse结果： `action='search' action_input='query'`

Problems Solved:

Incomplete Data: The original bad_response only provided the action field without the action_input field. OutputFixingParser has filled this gap by providing a value 'query' for the action_input field.
Problems Not Solved:

Specificity: Although OutputFixingParser provided a default value 'query' for the action_input field, it is not descriptive. The actual query is “What is the color of the Orchid?”. So, this fix only provides a generic value and does not truly answer the user’s question.
Potential Misleading: 'query' might be misunderstood as an instruction to further query something, rather than as the actual query input.
Of course, there are more robust options. Finally, let’s try the RetryWithErrorOutputParser parser.

```plain
# 初始化RetryWithErrorOutputParser，它会尝试再次提问来得到一个正确的输出
from langchain.output_parsers import RetryWithErrorOutputParser
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
retry_parser = RetryWithErrorOutputParser.from_llm(
    parser=parser, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0)
)
parse_result = retry_parser.parse_with_prompt(bad_response, prompt_value)
print('RetryWithErrorOutputParser的parse结果:',parse_result)

```

这个解析器没有让我们失望，成功地还原了格式，甚至也根据传入的原始提示，还原了action\_input字段的内容。

RetryWithErrorOutputParser的parse结果： `action='search' action_input='colors of Orchid'`

## Summary

Structured parsers and Pydantic parsers are both designed to obtain formatted output from large language models. Structured parsers are more suitable for simple text responses, while Pydantic parsers provide support for complex data structures and types. The choice of parser depends on the specific needs of the application and the complexity of the output.

Automatic fixing parsers are mainly used to correct minor formatting errors. They are more “passive,” only fixing issues when the original output has problems. Retry parsers, on the other hand, can handle more complex issues, including formatting errors and missing content. By re-interacting with the model, they make the output more complete and aligned with expectations.

When choosing which parser to use, it is important to consider the specific application scenario. If only facing formatting issues, an automatic fixing parser may be sufficient; but if the completeness and accuracy of the output are crucial, a retry parser might be a better choice.
